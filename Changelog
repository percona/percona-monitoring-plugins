2018-02-05: version 1.1.8
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Add MySQL 5.7 support
* Changed canary check to use timestamp.now() and return a timedelta.seconds
* Remove an additional condition for the Dictionary memory allocated
* Fixed a *false-positive* problem when the calculated delay was less than 0 and the -m was not set.
* Fixed the problem where slaves would alert due to deadlocks on the master.
* If using pt-heartbeat, get_slave_status was only called when the -s option is set to *MASTER*
* Disabled UNK alerts by default (it is possible to enable them explicitly).
* A fix was added for MySQL Multi-Source replication.
* The graph *Percona InnoDB Memory Allocation* showed zeroes for the
  metrics *Total memory* (data source item nl) and *Dictionary memory*
  (data source item nm) when used for MySQL 5.7.18, because the syntax
  of SHOW ENGINE INNODB STATUS has changed in MySQL 5.7 (see https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/innodb-standard-monitor.html).
* The graph *Percona InnoDB I/O Pending* showed *NaN* for the metrics
  *Pending Log Writes* (data source item hn) and *Pending Chkp Writes*
  (data source item hk) when used for MySQL 5.7.18, because the syntax
  of SHOW ENGINE INNODB STATUS has changed in MySQL 5.7 (see https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/innodb-standard-monitor.html).
* Added server @@hostname as a possible match to avoid DNS lookups whilst allowing hostname-match.

2016-12-09: version 1.1.7
-------------------------
* New Nagios script pmp-check-mongo.py for MongoDB.
* Added MySQL socket and flag options to Cacti php script.
* Added disk volume check on "Mounted on" in addition to "Filesystem" to Cacti php script to allow monitoring of tmpfs mounts.
* Allow delayed slave to have SQL thread stopped on pmp-check-mysql-replication-delay check.
* Fix for --unconfigured flag of pmp-check-mysql-replication-delay.
* Fix for max_duration check of pmp-check-mysql-innodb when system and MySQL timezones mismatch.
* Fix rare nrpe broken pipe error on pmp-check-unix-memory check.
* Updated package spec files.

2016-01-12: version 1.1.6
-------------------------
* Added new RDS instance classes to RDS scripts.
* Added boto profile support to RDS scripts.
* Added AWS region support and ability to specify all regions to RDS scripts.
* Added ability to set AWS region and boto profile on data source level in Cacti.
* Added period, average time and debug options to pmp-check-aws-rds.py.
* Added ability to override Nginx server status URL path on data source level in Cacti.
* Made Memcached and Redis host configurable for Cacti script.
* Added the ability to lookup the master's server_id when using pt-heartbeat with pmp-check-mysql-replication-delay.
* Changed how memory stats are collected by Cacti script and pmp-check-unix-memory.
  Now /proc/meminfo is parsed instead of running `free` command. This also fixes pmp-check-unix-memory for EL7.
* Set default MySQL connect timeout to 5s for Cacti script. Can be overridden in the config.
* Fixed innodb transactions count on the Cacti graph for MySQL 5.6 and higher.
* Fixed --login-path option in Nagios scripts when using it along with other credential options.
